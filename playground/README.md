# Readme

This is a simple example of a README file. You can use it as a template for your own projects.

## What is love!

I don't know, but I think it's something good.

I like to use quotes in my README files. Here's one of my favorites:

> "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened." - Dr. Seuss

Other things you can include in your README file:

- A list of features
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples

## How to use this template

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it to your local machine
3. Create a new branch

```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```
